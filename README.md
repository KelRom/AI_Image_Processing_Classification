# AI Image Processing and Classification Project

---

This project is designed to give me hands-on experience working with an image classifier and enhancing my programming skills using AI assistance. The project has three parts, each focused on different aspects of image classification and processing. By the end, I'll have explored fundamental concepts like Grad-CAM, image occlusion, and creative image filtering.
